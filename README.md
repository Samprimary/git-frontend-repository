RAIDER MAKER

A Database setup that could be expanded into a simple game for people to play.

- HTML, CSS, Javascript, Handlebars, jQuery, and AJAX used to create functionality.

- As a user, I want to be able to sign in and look at the assembled Raiders that can be used in game.

- As a user, I want to be able to create and adjust the numbers of raiders available to me.

Unsolved problems: plenty to do to create more functionality for the raiders once created.
